This course will give you four superpowers that will make you stand out from the data science crowd and build pipelines that stand the test of time: how to exhaustively tune every aspect of your model in development; how to make the best possible use of available domain expertise; how to monitor your model in performance and deal with any performance deterioration; and finally how to deal with poorly or scarcely labelled data. Digging deep into the cutting edge of sklearn, and dealing with real-life datasets from hot areas like personalized healthcare and cybersecurity, this course reveals a view of machine learning from the frontline."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vUA1RbO3S6x8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1. The Standard Workflow\n","\n","In this chapter, you will be reminded of the basics of a supervised learning workflow, complete with model fitting, tuning and selection, feature engineering and selection, and data splitting techniques. You will understand how these steps in a workflow depend on each other, and recognize how they can all contribute to, or fight against overfitting: the data scientist's worst enemy. By the end of the chapter, you will already be fluent in supervised learning, and ready to take the dive towards more advanced material in later chapters."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"S-urfCmnU7lo","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#### Supervised learning pipelines"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mlp8Wv1pke5t","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Feature engineering**\n","\n","You are tasked to predict whether a new cohort of loan applicants are likely to default on their loans.

You hence decide to encode the string columns numerically using `LabelEncoder()`. The function has been preloaded for you from the preprocessing submodule of sklearn. The dataset credit is also preloaded, as is a list of all column names whose data types are string, stored in `non_numeric_columns`."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XDO6o5BJlxDw","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2WpLbTf9lIWE","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["credit = pd.read_csv('credit.csv')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Aytw0RVBU-C9","colab_type":"code","outputId":"96825ced-4d3b-4f61-8642-aceb49054e63","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1563948357392,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1058,"user":{"displayName":"Zhenna LU","photoUrl":"","userId":"13596549313510787594"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":213}},"source":["# Inspect the first 3 lines of your data using head()\n","credit.head(3)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>checking_status</th>\n","      <th>duration</th>\n","      <th>credit_history</th>\n","      <th>purpose</th>\n","      <th>credit_amount</th>\n","      <th>savings_status</th>\n","      <th>employment</th>\n","      <th>installment_commitment</th>\n","      <th>personal_status</th>\n","      <th>other_parties</th>\n","      <th>residence_since</th>\n","      <th>property_magnitude</th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>other_payment_plans</th>\n","      <th>housing</th>\n","      <th>existing_credits</th>\n","      <th>job</th>\n","      <th>num_dependents</th>\n","      <th>own_telephone</th>\n","      <th>foreign_worker</th>\n","      <th>class</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>'&lt;0'</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>'critical/other existing credit'</td>\n","      <td>buy_radio_tv</td>\n","      <td>1169</td>\n","      <td>'no known savings'</td>\n","      <td>'&gt;=7'</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>'male single'</td>\n","      <td>none</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>'real estate'</td>\n","      <td>67</td>\n","      <td>none</td>\n","      <td>own</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>skilled</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>yes</td>\n","      <td>yes</td>\n","      <td>good</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>'0&lt;=X&lt;200'</td>\n","      <td>48</td>\n","      <td>'existing paid'</td>\n","      <td>buy_radio_tv</td>\n","      <td>5951</td>\n","      <td>'&lt;100'</td>\n","      <td>'1&lt;=X&lt;4'</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>'female div/dep/mar'</td>\n","      <td>none</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>'real estate'</td>\n","      <td>22</td>\n","      <td>none</td>\n","      <td>own</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>skilled</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>none</td>\n","      <td>yes</td>\n","      <td>bad</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>'no checking'</td>\n","      <td>12</td>\n","      <td>'critical/other existing credit'</td>\n","      <td>education</td>\n","      <td>2096</td>\n","      <td>'&lt;100'</td>\n","      <td>'4&lt;=X&lt;7'</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>'male single'</td>\n","      <td>none</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>'real estate'</td>\n","      <td>49</td>\n","      <td>none</td>\n","      <td>own</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>'unskilled resident'</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>none</td>\n","      <td>yes</td>\n","      <td>good</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["  checking_status  duration  ... foreign_worker class\n","0            '<0'         6  ...            yes  good\n","1      '0<=X<200'        48  ...            yes   bad\n","2   'no checking'        12  ...            yes  good\n","\n","[3 rows x 21 columns]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hYz6HNRSlode","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["non_numeric_columns = ['checking_status',\n"," 'credit_history',\n"," 'purpose',\n"," 'savings_status',\n"," 'employment',\n"," 'personal_status',\n"," 'other_parties',\n"," 'property_magnitude',\n"," 'other_payment_plans',\n"," 'housing',\n"," 'job',\n"," 'own_telephone',\n"," 'foreign_worker']"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RSS09Klilk2m","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Create a label encoder for each column.

In this chapter, you take on the challenge of modeling data without any, or with very few, labels. This takes you into a journey into anomaly detection, a kind of unsupervised modeling, as well as distance-based learning, where beliefs about what constitutes similarity between two examples can be used in place of labels to help you achieve levels of accuracy comparable to a supervised workflow. Upon completing this chapter, you will clearly stand out from the crowd of data scientists in confidently knowing what tools to use to modify your workflow in order to overcome common real-world challenges."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BKdnKpqEVPhD","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#### Anomaly detection"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DrQCefsNVz7y","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**A simple outlier**\n","\n","When you first encounter a new type of algorithm, it is always a great idea to test it with a very simple example.

So you decide to experiment some more with the hepatitis dataset introduced in the previous lesson. You are given three examples stored in features, whose classes are stored in labels. You will identify the nearest neighbor to the first example (row with index 0) using three different distance metrics, `Euclidean, Hamming and Chebyshev`, and on the basis of that choose which distance metric to use. You will import the necessary module as part of the exercise, but pandas and numpy already available, as are features and their labels labels."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Hs5rdfOWVWMD","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Import DistanceMetric as dm\n","from sklearn.neighbors import DistanceMetric as dm"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vlny3NK4S0xB","colab_type":"text"},"source":["- Compute the **pairwise** Euclidean, Hamming and Chebyshev distances for all points."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UIrY78CuS3hS","colab_type":"code","outputId":"7a05f1b1-0fde-46f0-c022-3240cc652aa7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1564379697899,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1468,"user":{"displayName":"Zhenna LU","photoUrl":"","userId":"13596549313510787594"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85}},"source":["# Find the Euclidean distance between all pairs\n","dist_eucl = dm.get_metric('euclidean').pairwise(features)\n","dist_eucl"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[  0.        , 197.95638408, 175.48461471, 114.781096  ],\n","       [197.95638408,   0.        ,  64.13236313, 126.56575366],\n","       [175.48461471,  64.13236313,   0.        , 143.93779907],\n","       [114.781096  , 126.56575366, 143.93779907,   0.        ]])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":74}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Re-5w_4oS-Ic","colab_type":"code","outputId":"dd519847-04be-4580-d984-3910ec777d0d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1564379711973,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":798,"user":{"displayName":"Zhenna LU","photoUrl":"","userId":"13596549313510787594"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85}},"source":["# Find the Hamming distance between all pairs\n","dist_hamm = dm.get_metric('hamming').pairwise(features)\n","dist_hamm"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[0.        , 0.63157895, 0.68421053, 0.63157895],\n","       [0.63157895, 0.        , 0.73684211, 0.63157895],\n","       [0.68421053, 0.73684211, 0.        , 0.57894737],\n","       [0.63157895, 0.63157895, 0.57894737, 0.        ]])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":75}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fM9ZNBBqTBa6","colab_type":"code","outputId":"4221377e-e4c7-414b-9942-0b8b2e6bb55f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1564379720474,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":756,"user":{"displayName":"Zhenna LU","photoUrl":"","userId":"13596549313510787594"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85}},"source":["# Find the Chebyshev distance between all pairs\n","dist_cheb = dm.get_metric('chebyshev').pairwise(features)\n","dist_cheb"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[  0., 190., 146., 107.],\n","       [190.,   0.,  46.,  88.],\n","       [146.,  46.,   0., 134.],\n","       [107.,  88., 134.,   0.]])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":76}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_qLBFT8VTM53","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Observation**\n","\n","Inspect the matrices dist_eucl, dist_hamm and dist_cheb in your terminal and identify the nearest neighbor to the first example for each metric.\n","\n","The Hamming metric correctly sets the first two examples, that both are of class 2.0, to be nearest neigbors."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_LR6b8QXTW0U","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Not all metrics agree**\n","\n","In the previous exercise you saw that not all metrics agree when it comes to identifying nearest neighbors.
