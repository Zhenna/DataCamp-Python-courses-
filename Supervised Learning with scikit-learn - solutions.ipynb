The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of 0 indicates that the patient does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient does have diabetes. As in Chapters 1 and 2, the dataset has been preprocessed to deal with missing values."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ikrZeut9lCGt","colab_type":"code","outputId":"ee4575ec-be37-400b-e3e8-c6ee65e81475","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1557572908216,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":771,"user":{"displayName":"Zhenna LU","photoUrl":"","userId":"13596549313510787594"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204}},"source":["df = pd.read_csv('/content/diabetes.csv')\n","df.head()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>pregnancies</th>\n","      <th>glucose</th>\n","      <th>diastolic</th>\n","      <th>triceps</th>\n","      <th>insulin</th>\n","      <th>bmi</th>\n","      <th>dpf</th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>diabetes</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>148</td>\n","      <td>72</td>\n","      <td>35</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>33.6</td>\n","      <td>0.627</td>\n","      <td>50</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>85</td>\n","      <td>66</td>\n","      <td>29</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>26.6</td>\n","      <td>0.351</td>\n","      <td>31</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>8</td>\n","      <td>183</td>\n","      <td>64</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>23.3</td>\n","      <td>0.672</td>\n","      <td>32</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>89</td>\n","      <td>66</td>\n","      <td>23</td>\n","      <td>94</td>\n","      <td>28.1</td>\n","      <td>0.167</td>\n","      <td>21</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>137</td>\n","      <td>40</td>\n","      <td>35</td>\n","      <td>168</td>\n","      <td>43.1</td>\n","      <td>2.288</td>\n","      <td>33</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   pregnancies  glucose  diastolic  triceps  insulin   bmi    dpf  age  \\\n","0            6      148         72       35        0  33.6  0.627   50   \n","1            1       85         66       29        0  26.6  0.351   31   \n","2            8      183         64        0        0  23.3  0.672   32   \n","3            1       89         66       23       94  28.1  0.167   21   \n","4            0      137         40       35      168  43.1  2.288   33   \n","\n","   diabetes  \n","0         1  \n","1         0  \n","2         1  \n","3         0  \n","4         1  "]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":148}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PbOP3J-klJlu","colab_type":"code","outputId":"f8187f58-b952-4d57-d5b4-13eb430ad874","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1557572928687,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":543,"user":{"displayName":"Zhenna LU","photoUrl":"","userId":"13596549313510787594"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["df.shape #
